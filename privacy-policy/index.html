					<h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
					<p>ScaleMonk. ScaleMonk, Inc. (“ScaleMonk”, “we”, “us” and “our”) is a global provider of digital advertising technology that powers ads that appear on third party websites and mobile applications (referred to as “Digital Properties”) on your mobile devices. We do this through our technology platform (the “Platform”), which provides a variety of tools and services that make the buying of ad space efficient and effective for advertisers and other ad buyers (referred to as our “clients”) to purchase ad space on digital properties provided by publishers and the parties that represent them, such as supply-side platforms and ad networks (referred to as our “supply partners”). Our Platform helps advertisers reach their target audiences with more relevant ads resulting in improved performance and control for advertisers and a better Internet experience for users.</p>
					<p>To deliver relevant advertising to you, the Platform may collect information about your activity across multiple third-party Digital Properties. The Platform uses this information in order to predict the types of ads that may interest you and display advertising to you based on that information (“Behavioral Advertising”).</p>
					<p>To learn more about Behavioral Advertising and your choices with respect to it, please visit <a href="www.aboutads.info/consumers" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info/consumers</a> and <a href="www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising</a></p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>a. Scope of Privacy Policy</strong></li>

To ensure that your privacy is protected and that your information choices are respected, we describe in this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) how we may collect, use and share data we collect from you when you visit our website at <a href="www.scalemonk.com">www.scalemonk.com</a> (the “Website”) and interact with our Platform.</li>
						<li>Please note that this Privacy Policy relates solely to the personal data we collect and process about you through the Platform or Website. The ads delivered by the Platform may appear on a variety of other third-party Digital Properties. ScaleMonk does not control these third-party Digital Properties and is not responsible for their privacy practices. You should refer to the privacy statements of such third-party Digital Properties that you visit to find out how they collect and use your personal information.</li>

					<h2>6. THE EU GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (GDPR)</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>a. ScaleMonk as a Data Controller and a Data Processor</strong></li>
						<li>“Personal Data” is a term used in the GDPR that means, generally, data that identifies or can identify a particular unique user or device – for example, names, addresses, cookie IDs, mobile ad IDs, precise location data and biometric data. European data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process Personal Data for their own purposes (known as “data controllers”) and organizations that process Personal Data on behalf of other organizations (known as “data processors”). We sometimes act as a data controller and sometimes (such as when we are handling our clients’ information) as a data processor. This section only applies when we process your Personal Data as a data controller; when we act as a data processor, it is our client (the data controller) to whom you would need to address any questions or seek enforcement of your data subject rights (such as access to or deletion of your Personal Data).</li>
						<li><strong>b.	Legal Basis for Processing</strong></li>
						<li>If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, which consists of the European Union, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, our legal basis for collecting and processing your Personal Data will depend on the information concerned and the specific context in which we collect and process it. Our legal basis for processing your Personal Data for the purposes described in Sections 2a and 2d will typically rely on:</li>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>•</strong> Your consent. In some cases, we rely on your consent in order to process your Personal Data. For example, we rely on your consent when we store and gain access to information stored on your device. For this “cookie consent” (which applies to both cookies and mobile ad IDs), we rely on mobile application developers and contractually require them to only transmit legally obtained information. We do so to fulfill our obligations under the ePrivacy Directive. We may choose to obtain consent in other cases as well, such as when we process data that you voluntarily provide through our Website and offline, in which case we will adhere to applicable laws relating to such consent and its withdrawal.</li>
							<li><strong>•</strong> Legitimate interests. In some cases, we collect Personal Data from you where the processing is in our (or a third party’s, such as our clients’) legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, such as your right to opt-out. If we collect and use your Personal Data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), these interests will typically be to operate the Platform (such as to detect fraud or to ensure that bugs are detected and fixed).</li>
							<li><strong>•</strong> Legal obligations. Some processing of data may be necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations.</li>
						</ul>
						<li><strong>c. International Transfer of Data</strong></li>
						<li>As ScaleMonk works with global companies and technologies, we may need to transfer your Personal Data outside of the country from which it was originally collected. For example, we may transfer your data to third parties that we work with who may be located outside of the European Economic Area. When we transfer Personal Data outside of the European Economic Area, we take steps to make sure that safeguards are in place to protect your Personal Data, including, when required by European data protection law, entering into European Standard Contractual Clauses and Data Processing Agreements. Please contact us at the contact information below for more information about the safeguards we have put in place to protect your Personal Data and privacy rights in these circumstances.</li>
						<li><strong>d. Your Rights as a Data Subject</strong></li>
						<li>As a resident of the European Economic Area, you have certain rights with respect to Personal Data that we hold about you as a data controller. You may contact us at privacy@scalemonk.com in order to exercise the following rights:</li>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>•</strong> The right to ask us to provide you with copies of the Personal Data that we hold about you. When we receive your request, we will provide you with step-by-step instructions to follow.</li>
							<li><strong>•</strong> The right to ask us to update or correct any out-of-date or incorrect Personal Data that we hold about you.</li>
							<li><strong>•</strong> The right to withdraw your consent for processing Personal Data on which we rely on consent to process. Once we receive your request, we will cease processing your Personal Data within 30 days or less. You may also withdraw your consent by using the device-based opt-out described in Section 5 above.</li>
							<li><strong>•</strong> The right to manually request that we delete your Personal Data, subject to our instructions to confirm your identity. You may also make this request by opting out through device settings as described above. Upon receiving this opt-out signal, your Personal Data will be deleted within 30 days if you have an Android device, or if you have an iOS device, we will permanently render the Personal Data disconnected from your device.</li>
							<li><strong>•</strong> In addition, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. However, we hope that you will first consult with us so that we may work with you to resolve any complaint or concern you may have.</li>
